In 2024/25, I am teaching the following courses at Durham University:

- MATH3411: Advanced Statistical Modelling III (Term 1).  

- MATH42815: Master of Data Science module on Machine Learning (First half). 

Both of these course I have now taught several times before (ASM in 2022/23 and 2023/24, and ML in 2021/22 and 2022/23).
